# Title: Booking System
# Description: Take information inputted by user to find the best route for a package
#               Intended for developer to make front end, basics for user.
# ChangeLog (Jack Kennedy,06/13/2020,Reread to not overcomplicate things):
# JJack,6.13.2021,Created started script
# Jack Kennedy, 06/13/2021, Worked on script
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# GOALS
# Set up Data Structure to save PACKAGE INFO AND OUTCOME to CSV file = COMPLETE
# Create process to book ONE PACKAGE, DON"T NEED TO DO SEVERAL!!! = COMPLETE
#           Note: ACTUAL DELIVERY DATE DOES NOT MATTER!!! Either it's below or over 3 days
# Create a Menus including: 1. Book Quote Package, 2. Display History of Packages, 3. Exit
#           Note: Project does not call for editing data. Do not need to create script to
#           extract data to edit booking information. Could be added, not required.
#           Script only serves one purpose, doesn't need big menu.
#           Honestly, the history part is only for testing. Don't even need that.
# Create a set of variables to compare all booking options, then display THE CHEAPEST ONE(S)!!! to user = COMPLETED
#           Note: User might be curious to know what the other options are. Not required, but could
#           add an option at the end to display what all options look like.
#           ONLY NEED THE CHEAPEST OPTION TO SAVE TO CSV FILE
